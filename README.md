# Recreation and Travel
  -Code to Create ACM

### Problem-

 People planning leisure travel typically have certain budget in mind and
some preferences about type of destination.<br>
 Most travel search and booking portals start with destination and the
process is still generations old and very tedious.<br>
 Requires travelers to try various combinations before finally deciding.<br>
 A solution to this would be a hassle free program that can help you book a
flight to and fro from your destination and also find out the hotels near you
at the cheapest cost.<br>

### our Proposal-

 We made a voice controlled software which you can use to book flights
and hotels according to your wish.<br>
 You need to specify your dates of travel and the number of people who
are traveling with you as in adults, children and infants.<br>
 You specify the place of travel and your budget.<br>
 You can then view the hotels there at the cheapest cost.<br>
 Your travel plan sorted you can actually enjoy your trip!!!<br>

### How we can do it-

 We are using Google Text to Speech to read out everything.<br>
 We have hard coded the program and the url thus enabling us to open the
required site when entering the particular destination.<br>
 We put the places in a dictionary with place name and airport name of
that place.<br>
 For hotels we took in the number of people staying and stay duration along
with the room type.<br>
 We displayed the required information and using gtts, spoke it out aloud for the user to hear.<br>

### Need for it-

 Not everyone wants to continuously search for the details by typing in
again and again.<br>
 Instead if they speak the details out once, our program can show them all
the required information so that they can book with ease.<br>
 It reduces time taken to book as well as the program can show the flights and hotels at the cheapest costs thus saving money.<br>

### Problems we might face-

 If you don’t know where to go, we wont be able to suggest a place for
you.<br>
 Since everyone has a budget, to give the best hotel in that area, would be
a problem as it wouldn’t be possible to fit it in the required cost.<br>
 Due to late bookings, cost of flights increase tremendously.<br>
### Feasibility-

 This project is very feasible as it requires only time and knowledge of the
programmer to do it.<br>
 The cost of the Laptop could be taken into consideration but, no extra costs are undertaken.<br>
