Code to Create ACM

Problem

 People planning leisure travel typically have certain budget in mind and
some preferences about type of destination.
 Most travel search and booking portals start with destination and the
process is still generations old and very tedious.
 Requires travelers to try various combinations before finally deciding.
 A solution to this would be a hassle free program that can help you book a
flight to and fro from your destination and also find out the hotels near you
at the cheapest cost.

Our Proposal

 We made a voice controlled software which you can use to book flights
and hotels according to your wish.
 You need to specify your dates of travel and the number of people who
are traveling with you as in adults, children and infants.
 You specify the place of travel and your budget.
 You can then view the hotels there at the cheapest cost.
 Your travel plan sorted you can actually enjoy your trip!!!

How we can do it
 We are using Google Text to Speech to read out everything.
 We have hard coded the program and the url thus enabling us to open the
required site when entering the particular destination.
 We put the places in a dictionary with place name and airport name of
that place.
 For hotels we took in the number of people staying and stay duration along
with the room type.
 We displayed the required information and using gtts, spoke it out aloud for the user to hear.

Need for it
 Not everyone wants to continuously search for the details by typing in
again and again.
 Instead if they speak the details out once, our program can show them all
the required information so that they can book with ease.
 It reduces time taken to book as well as the program can show the flights and hotels at the cheapest costs thus saving money.

Problems we might face
 If you don’t know where to go, we wont be able to suggest a place for
you.
 Since everyone has a budget, to give the best hotel in that area, would be
a problem as it wouldn’t be possible to fit it in the required cost.
 Due to late bookings, cost of flights increase tremendously.

Feasibility
 This project is very feasible as it requires only time and knowledge of the
programmer to do it.
 The cost of the Laptop could be taken into consideration but, no extra costs are undertaken.
